Thereâ€™s **no off-the-shelf package** that will do exactly what you're being asked (i.e., simulate fish-like movement in React), but you can use a combination of **React hooks**, **animation libraries**, and **vector math** to build the desired movement logic.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of tools and techniques you can use:

---

### âœ… 1. **React Animation/Movement Tools**
- **Framer Motion** (for animating DOM elements smoothly)
- **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform â€“ more powerful but heavier)
- **React Spring** (for physics-based animations)

These are great for creating smooth transitions, but **they wonâ€™t give you natural fish movement out of the box** â€” youâ€™ll need to write the logic using vector physics or behavior models.

---

### âœ… 2. **Math & Movement Logic Tools**
- **`useRaf` (RequestAnimationFrame)** for smooth continuous movement.
- **Vector Math** using:
  - `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, angle rotations
  - Position updates: `position += velocity * deltaTime`
- For more advanced logic, consider:
  - **Boids Algorithm** (used for flocking/schooling)
  - **Finite State Machines (FSM)** for states like `idle`, `dart`, `hover`

---

### ðŸ”§ Recommended Plan

1. **Create `useFishMovement` Hook**:
   - Assign each fish:
     - Speed
     - Rotation angle
     - Behavior state
   - Update position and direction with physics-style motion using `requestAnimationFrame`.

2. **Encapsulate Behavior Types**:
   - Idle: slow, smooth drifting
   - Dart: fast direction change + speed burst
   - Hover: minimal x/y movement + floaty effect
   - You can randomize transitions or base them on timers.

3. **Handle Boundaries**:
   - When approaching the edge, either:
     - Bounce off
     - Turn around
     - Wrap around (if desired)

4. **Avoid Collisions**:
   - Use basic distance checking between fish and apply steering forces to avoid overlap.

### ðŸ§  Inspiration from Packages (But Not Plug & Play)
- [**`boids-ts`**](https://github.com/mir3z/boids-ts) â€” TypeScript Boids implementation you can borrow logic from.
- [**`use-boids`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-boids) â€” Not actively maintained but could give insight.
- **Three.js examples of Boids** (not React, but helpful for logic): [https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_flocking](https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_flocking)

### ðŸ›‘ Don't Use:
- Naive random values
- Static animations or CSS keyframes for position
- Repeated re-renders without proper throttling (`requestAnimationFrame` is a must)

---

### âœ… Conclusion
There is **no single package** that solves everything you need. Instead, combine:
- A **custom `useFishMovement` hook**
- **Physics-inspired movement** (angle, velocity, boundary checking)
- **React animation** libraries (Framer Motion, GSAP) for smooth transitions
